# Image Labels Generator using AWS

![AWS Logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Amazon_Web_Services_Logo.svg/1280px-Amazon_Web_Services_Logo.svg.png)

This project implements an image labels generator using AWS services such as Lambda, S3, and Rekognition. It detects labels in images uploaded to an S3 bucket and saves the detected labels as JSON files along with the original images.

## Overview

The image labels generator utilizes the following AWS services:

- **Lambda**: Executes the Python code to detect labels in images.
- **S3**: Stores both the original images and the detected labels JSON files.
- **Rekognition**: Performs the image analysis to detect labels.

## Usage Guide

Follow the steps below to set up and use the image labels generator:

1. **Set Up AWS Account**:
   - If you haven't already, sign up for an AWS account at [AWS website](https://aws.amazon.com/).

2. **Create an S3 Bucket**:
   - Go to the [Amazon S3 console](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/).
   - Click "Create bucket" and provide a unique bucket name.

3. **Set Up an IAM Role**:
   - Go to the [IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/).
   - Create a role with necessary permissions for Lambda to access S3 and Rekognition.

4. **Create a Lambda Function**:
   - Go to the [Lambda console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/).
   - Create a function with Python runtime and attach the IAM role created in step 3.

5. **Write Lambda Function Code**:
   - Use the provided Python code to detect labels in images and upload results to S3.

6. **Configure Lambda Trigger**:
   - Add an S3 trigger for the Lambda function to listen to the S3 bucket created in step 2.

7. **Testing**:
   - Upload an image file to the S3 bucket and check the CloudWatch logs for detected labels.

## Instructions

- Replace placeholders in the Python code with your S3 bucket names and other configurations.
- Customize the code further based on your requirements, such as error handling or additional functionalities.

## Monitoring and Optimization

- Monitor the Lambda function's performance and optimize as needed.
- Implement error handling and logging for robustness.
- Consider setting up alarms and notifications for critical events.
